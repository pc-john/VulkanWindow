# Module for finding GLFW3
#
# It attempts to perform config-based find first. If it fails, it attempts to find includes and libraries using standard way.
#
# Targets (used by both - config find and standard find):
#    glfw (glfw is used instead of glfw3 because of glfw uses it like this)
#
# Cache variables (used by both - config find and standard find):
#    glfw_DLL (on Win32 only)
#
# Cache variables that are used if config-based find fails:
#    glfw_INCLUDE_DIR
#    glfw_LIBRARY
#


# try config-based find first
# but only if the user did not specified its own include dir or library
